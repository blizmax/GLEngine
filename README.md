# GLEngine

A complete game engine developed by Michael Buerger
Using the following libraries:

- [glfw](https://www.glfw.org) (Windows, Input Handling, etc)
- [glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net) (OpenGL Extension Wrangler)
- [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html) (OpenGL Mathematics)
- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog) (Fast C++ logging, fancy colored text in console)
- [stb_image.h](https://github.com/nothings/stb) (Single-file image loader)
- [CPPModelLibrary](https://github.com/popwser/CPPModelLibrary) (CPP library for loading model files)

## Installation

All libraries/binaries used within the engine are self-contained in the repository except for the following:

- glew (**required**)
- cloc (not required)
- valgrind (not required)

#### Installing glew-2.1.0:

1. Go to the [GLEW Sourceforge](http://glew.sourceforge.net/) page.
2. Find the download for version [2.1.0](https://sourceforge.net/projects/glew/files/glew/2.1.0/).
3. Download the applicable file (win32.zip, zip, or tgz).
4. Take the contained glew-2.1.0 folder and move it into the project directory.
5. Within a terminal run: `make make-project` to build the necessary dependencies with CMake.

#### Installing cloc:

- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt install cloc`
- **macOS**: Install **homebrew** then run`brew install cloc`

#### Installing valgrind:

- **Ubuntu/Debian**: `sudo apt install valgrind`
- **macOS**: Install **homebrew** then run`brew install valgrind`

## Running

**The following commands can be run from a terminal in the project directory**:

- `make all` or `make`: Says what each make function does
- `make make-project`: Builds necessary dependencies with CMake
- `make build-project`: Builds the engine
- `make execute-project`: Executes main.cpp
- `make build-execute project`: Runs `build-project` then `execute-project`
- `make qea`: Runs `make-project` then `build-project` then `execute-project`
- `make line-count`: Queries line counts of various parts of the engine's code
- `make clean`: Runs all of the following clean commands
- `make clean-bin`: Clears bin directory of engine (not including sub-directories)

**Developer's Note:**

When adding new cpp files to the engine, re-running `make-project` is required for them to be added to the CMake project.
